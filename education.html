In addition to spreading the knowledge of iGEM, we discussed how important it is to engage in research, and explained how one could start obtaining research experience at an early age. We also did a kahoot with the students to add an interactive component to our presentation and we were impressed by how much the students learned.

Our presentation outlined the basics of biology, synthetic biology, and our plant research project. Through our presentation, students were also able to learn about research opportunities at the high school and collegiate level. As an incentive and approach to have the students participate, we did a Kahoot at the end to see how much the students learnd. The camp was structured around learning about DNA, proteins, and plasmids. Therefore, since the students had an introductory synthetic biology background, they were able to answer most of our Kahoot questions correctly and we were impressed by their enthusiasm.

They were able to bring home the strawberry DNA as a necklace or bracelet. We chose this as an activity in order to inspire and introduce younger children to the fields of biology and synthetic biology. For high school students, parents and other adults who visited our booth, we presented our project and explained the importance of synthetic biology.
