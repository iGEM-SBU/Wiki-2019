        Sowing
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fill flat (4 wells x 8 wells) with Cornell Mix – (no osmocote). Fill flat and level off extra soil. Then gently pack in each well a little. Fill remaining space with soil and level off extra soil. Water the flats once, allow water to soak through, then water a second time.</li>
        <li>Put a small amount of seed in a folded, white paper and gently tap the edge of the paper so that a couple seeds fall off at a time. Aim to sow around 10 seeds in a well. Cover lightly with vermiculite when done sowing. Cover flat with a humidity dome. The dome can be removed after germination (~5 days).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="ui header">
        Thinning
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>When the plants are 1 week old, use tweezers to thin the plants to 2-3 seedlings per well, trying to leave remaining seedlings that are well-spaced.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="ui header">
        Transplanting
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>When the plants are 3 weeks old, they can be transplanted. Fill 6” pots with Cornell+Osmocote, leaving about a centimeter of space at the top. Water pots once and let excess water drain. Water pots a second time. Make sure the soil isn’t oversaturated, but that it is evenly watered throughout.</li>

        <li>Make a small hole in the soil in the center of the pot. Remove plants from flats without breaking too much of the roots, ideally removing the entire chunk of soil from the well. If there are 2 or 3 plants in one well, carefully separate plants and try to be as gentle on the roots as possible while transplanting. Place plant into hole in the pot and bring surrounding soil up towards the seedling to fill in any gaps. Ensure that no roots are exposed. Avoid pressing down on the soil or plant as N. benth are sensitive to compression.</li>

        <li>Ideally, a finished transplant will have a subtle mound in the center where the plant is with surrounding soil sloping slightly. During regular watering, this helps guide excess water away from the plant to prevent accidental overwatering.</li>
