        Members from previous Stony Brook iGEM Teams were teaching assistants for our spring reading course about iGEM. They helped clarify terminology surrounding synthetic biology, gave tips about how to design our construct, and gave some insight into what worked well and what did not work well in the past. We are also thankful for the TAs for coming in during the summer and helping us when we needed it.
